# SidebarICNS
Proof of concept to change folder icons in the sidebar.
Uses a Finder Sync extension with custom app resources. Path is
hardcoded, check SidebarPlugin/FinderSync.swift to change, and update
SidebarICNS/SidebarICNS.iconset to change the sidebar icon. You'll
probably need to change the package name too.
